# Background

Degradation of tributary habitat has been implicated as a major factor contributing to declines of Pacific salmon *Oncorhynchus* spp. Tributary habitat rehabilitation actions are necessary towards stemming population declines. However, habitat use information for juvenile salmonids, particularly during winter months, is not well documented. 

Habitat requirements for fish include physical and biological components necessary to complete life histories and ensure population viability [@Newcomb2007; @Rosenfeld2003]. Habitat availability can be defined as the accessibility of such components by a fish [@Johnson1980]. Alternatively, habitat use is the way a fish exploits the physical and biological resources available to them [@Favrot2018]. Habitat suitability measures a specific available habitat's capacity to support a fish, the most suitable habitats being optimal [@Bovee1986]. Available habitats can be hierarchically characterized by a spectrum ranging from least suitable (i.e., avoided) to most suitable (i.e., optimal). Habitat selection is determined when a fish chooses a physical or biological component from a spectrum of available habitats [@Johnson1980]. If habitat use is proportionally equivalent to habitat availability (i.e., no preference), then habitat use is considered random. However, when a fish selects for a specific physical or biological component given equal available habitat, this is considered preferred habitat (e.g., laboratory experiment: @Johnson1980). Critical habitat provides components essential to sensitive life stages (e.g., early life history: @Pitlo1989, @Newcomb2007).  Winter habitat is thought be critical because of specific biological conditions required by fish for survival and condition factor maintenance during this time period [@Favrot2018]. However, due to extreme environs (e.g., surface ice), minimal research has characterized winter microhabitat use and suitability empirically for Pacific salmon parr [@Huusko2007].


## Objectives

The goal of this study was to characterize microhabitat use and preference for juvenile Chinook salmon *O. tshawytscha* in the lower Lemhi River during winter months. Habitat availability data and use data were collected in the lower Lemhi River using methods similar to those described by @Favrot2018 and implemented in Catherine Creek, Oregon. The habitat availability and use information will be used to describe habitat preference of juvenile Chinook salmon overwintering in the lower Lemhi River, which can in turn be used to describe target habitat conditions to be used in habitat restoration planning and designs.


# Methods

## Habitat Availability

```{r hab-avail-data}
center_pts_all = st_read("S:/main/data/habitat/lemhi_telemetry/availability/raw/Centerline_XS_Intersects.shp",
                         quiet = T) %>%
  st_zm() %>%
  mutate(Category = factor(Category,
                           levels = c("Low",
                                      "Med",
                                      "High")))

```

Microhabitat availability data were collected in the lower Lemhi River using line-transect survey techniques similar to those described by @Favrot2018. Line-transect techniques can minimize measurement error and are more repeatable than visual techniques [@McMahon1996; @Stanfield1998]. Microhabitat availability data were collected during base-flow conditions in August 2019 and variables measured at each transect point corresponded to microhabitat use variables (described below). Points were placed each 1 m along a linear network of the lower Lemhi River from its confluence with Hayden Creek downstream to its confluence with the Salmon River, resulting in `r prettyNum(nrow(center_pts_all), big.mark = ",")` points in total. Each point was then categorized as occurring within a low, medium, or high sinuosity reach (calculated at the 500m reach scale) of the lower Lemhi River (Table \@ref(tab:sin-table)).

```{r sin-table}
sin_tbl = tibble(
  Category = c("Low", "Med", "High"),
  Minimum = c(
    min(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "Low"]),
    min(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "Med"]),
    min(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "High"])
  ),
  Maximum = c(
    max(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "Low"]),
    max(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "Med"]),
    max(center_pts_all$Sinuosity[center_pts_all$Category == "High"])
  ),
  `Length (m)` = c(
    nrow(center_pts_all[center_pts_all$Category == "Low", ]),
    nrow(center_pts_all[center_pts_all$Category == "Med", ]),
    nrow(center_pts_all[center_pts_all$Category == "High", ])
  )
) %>%
  kbl(caption = "The number of points within each sinousity category including the minimum and maximum sinuosity values for reach category.",
      format.args = list(digits = 4,
                         big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = F)
sin_tbl

```

We then randomly sampled an approximately equal number of points within each sinuosity category (Table \@ref(tab:xs-table)) and transects were placed at a right angle to the flow at each of the sampled points. At each transect, we then started at the wetted width midpoint (`xs_point_number = 0`) of the river and sampled every 1m to river right and river left (facing downstream), including the midpoint, to the wetted margin. Points to river right were designated positive (+) and points towards river left were designated negative (-) and habitat availability measurements were taken at each point.<!-- Need to verify those previous statements. Did we sample each meter and was river right (facing downstream) designated positive?--> Habitat availability measurements were taken at each point describing channel unit type, bank condition, dominant substrate, availability of substrate concealment, presence of adjacent side channels, dominant cover type, and distance to cover. In addition, depth and velocity estimates for each point were available from LiDAR-derived 2D numerical models. In total, habitat measurements were collected from `r nrow(xs_summary)` transects and `r prettyNum(sum(xs_summary$n_pts), big.mark = ",")` points, resulting in an average of `r round(sum(xs_summary$n_pts) / nrow(xs_summary), 1)` points per transect.

```{r xs-table}
xs_tbl = tibble(
  Category = c("Low", "Med", "High"),
  `n Transects` = c(
    nrow(xs_summary[xs_summary$sin_cat == "Low", ]),
    nrow(xs_summary[xs_summary$sin_cat == "Med", ]),
    nrow(xs_summary[xs_summary$sin_cat == "High", ])
  ),
  `n Transect Points` = c(
    sum(xs_summary$n_pts[xs_summary$sin_cat == "Low"]),
    sum(xs_summary$n_pts[xs_summary$sin_cat == "Med"]),
    sum(xs_summary$n_pts[xs_summary$sin_cat == "High"])
  )
) %>%
  mutate(`Avg. Points per Transect` = round(`n Transect Points` / `n Transects`, 1)) %>%
  kbl(caption = "The number of points within each sinousity category including the minimum and maximum sinuosity values for reach category.",
      format.args = list(digits = 4,
                         big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = F)
xs_tbl

```

## Habitat Use

Microhabitat use data were collected from radio-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon in the lower Lemhi River beginning in November 2019 through March 2020. For the study, a total of 279 fish were tagged from October 9-31, 2019 at three rotary screw trap (RST) locations in the Lemhi River subbasin: upper Lemhi RST (LEMTRP), Hayden Creek RST (HYDTRP), and lower Lemhi RST (LLRTP). Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. (ATS; hhtps://atstrack.com) radio transmitters (Model #ST100L) were surgical implanted into the abdomen of Chinook salmon presmolts, ranging in length from 98 mm-138 mm and weight from 10.4 g-31.1 g.  Fish were also implanted with a Passive Integrated Transponder tag (PIT tag). Tagged fish were held for a minimum of six hours in live wells and released at night below the tagging sites once they had fully recovered from surgery.

Because of limited battery life, radio tags were programmed to operate in three batches to cover the entire winter season.  Batch 1 transmitters (181 fish) were programmed to operate continuously upon activation, batch 2 transmitters (47 fish) operated for an hour upon activation then shutdown to reactivate at day 50, and batch 3 transmitters (51 fish) operated for an hour upon activation then shutdown to reactivate at day 100.

Throughout the winter, mobile tracking surveys were completed by boat and on foot, dependent on weather and river conditions.  Surveys covered 50 km of the lower Lemhi River from its confluence with Hayden Creek  downstream to its confluence with the Salmon River approximately every two weeks. When a transmitter was detected, surveyors pin-pointed the signal location to the finest scale possible (typically < 1 m^2), tried to determine if the tag was in a live fish, and recorded the location using an EOS Arrow 100 GNSS GPS receiver with sub-meter accuracy. Habitat metrics describing channel unit type, bank condition, dominant substrate, availability of substrate concealment, dominant cover type, distance to cover, depth, and mean column velocity, were also collected at each tag location. 

```{r}
# filter for tags recovered by unique radio tag
use_recovered <- xs_use %>%
  filter(tag_status == "Recovered") %>%
  distinct(radio_frequency)

# summarize count of unique radio tags detected 
use_unique <- xs_use %>%
  distinct(radio_frequency) 

#summarize count of qualified, unique observations
use_selected <- xs_all %>%
  filter(habitat_selected_new == "Yes")

```

Mobile tracking surveys resulted in a detection total of `r nrow(use_unique)` unique radio tags of which `r nrow(use_recovered)` were physically recovered (one confirmed mortality). The high recovery rate of detected tags (22%) combined with the inability to confirm tag detections as live fish created some uncertainty about the validity of fish use data.  To address this, a decision tree was developed based on professional expertise and published literature [@Holleman2022] to qualify tag detection locations as selected for habitat (Figure \@ref(fig:tree-fig)). Using the decision tree, `r nrow(use_selected)` unique selected habitat locations were identified.

```

First, we wanted to assess whether the habitat availability data collected in August 2019 was sufficient to capture the overall distribution of available habitat throughout the lower Lemhi River, or whether addition habitat availablity data were needed. Again, in August 2019, a total of `r nrow(xs_summary)` transects (cross-sections) were sampled, based on a stratified sample where strata were defined by low, medium, and high sinuosity (Tables \@ref(tab:sin-table) & \@ref(tab:xs-table)). We started by examining the depth and velocity values available from raster build on 2D numerical models for the entire lower Lemhi. We then extracted depth and velocity values from points along the sampled transects, and compared those distributions with the distributions of depth and velocity for the entire available raster. Our hypothesis is that if the distributions are similar between the entire raster and the sampled transects, then the sample has done an adequate job of capturing the distribution of available habitat.


## Habitat Preference

After filtering the found radio tags to include only those fish that we deemed selected a given location, we compared the available habitat to the habitat used by radio-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon. To date, we made comparisons for the following categories:

* Sinuosity
* Depth and Velocity
* Channel Unit Types
* Substrate Concealment
* Cover within 1.5 m

### Sinuosity

First, we looked at the proportions of available habitat and selected habitat by sinuosity categories in the lower Lemhi to see if there were any distribution patterns on the reach scale. 

### Depth and Velocity

Depth (m) and mean column velocity (m/s) was measured at 47 of the `r nrow(use_selected)` selected habitat locations.  Environmental conditions (primarily surface ice and depth) prevented collection of depth and velocity measurements at some selected locations, likely introducing bias to this analysis, particularly habitat selection by depth. However, because our decision tree accounted for velocity limits of sustained swimming of juvenile salmonids, we feel confident the locations where mean column velocity was measured is a representative sample of habitat use locations in the lower Lemhi.

For this analysis we compared boxplot distributions of depth and velocity from raster data corresponding with the point locations measured during the microhabitat availability survey (n=`r prettyNum(sum(xs_summary$n_pts), big.mark = ",")`) to depth and velocity measurements taken in the field during microhabitat use surveys. We used a variance test (F test; how far each data point is from the group mean), to evaluate variances between the habitat availability and habitat use datasets. This led us to use an unpooled, two sample test (Welch test) to determine if there's a significant difference (p-value < 0.05) between mean available depth and velocity and mean selected depth and velocity in the lower Lemhi.     

### Channel Unit Types

Because there are multiple types of channel units, we employed a goodness-of-fit test for discrete multivariate data. This test compares the observed channel unit type that radio-tagged juveniles were found in with the proportion of channel unit types from the habitat availability dataset. The null hypothesis is that the "use" tags will be found in similar channel unit types relative to what is available. Because there are `r n_distinct(xs_all$channel_unit_type)` channel unit types, this leads to a large number of potential arrangements. Therefore, we used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate `r prettyNum(1e5, scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` samples of $n$ observations ($n$ being the number of selected "use" channel units) using the habitat availability proportions of channel unit types. The p-value is then calculated by summing the relative frequencies of outcomes occurring less frequently than the observed ones, so a low p-value indicates that the observed "use" channel types are distributed differently that the available ones, suggesting that fish are not randomly distributed in overwinter habitat. We also used a log likelihood ratio goodness of fit test (G-test).


### Concealment

Because concealment is binary (either available or not), we tested whether there were differences between habitat availability and use using a Chi-squared test, as well as a G-test.


### Cover

For the purposed of our initial cover analysis, we grouped all types of cover into a single category, and compared that with the category of "no cover". This made cover a binary variable, like concealment, allowing us to also use the Chi-squared and G-test.


# Results

## Habitat Availability Power Analysis

Results of the habitat availability power analysis are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dist-fig). 

```{r dist-fig, fig.cap = "Density plots of depth and velocity, colored by whether taken from the entire raster (All) or the sampled transects (Sampled), faceted by sinuosity category."}
comp_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = raster_val,
             color = source,
             fill = source)) +

  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Set1',
                     name = 'Source') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1',
                     name = 'Source') +
  facet_grid(sin_class ~ metric,
             scales = 'free') +
  # facet_wrap(~ metric + sin_class, 
  #            scales = 'free',
  #            nrow = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = 'Raster Value')

```


## Habitat Preference

### Sinuosity

```{r sin-use, fig.cap = "Percent of available and selected habitat by sinuosity category in the lower Lemhi."}

# percentage available habitat by sinuosity
sin_all <- center_pts_all %>%
st_drop_geometry() %>%
select(Category) %>%
count(Category) %>%
mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)) %>%
add_column(Habitat = "Available")

# percentage use habitat by sinuosity 
sin_use <- xs_use %>%
filter(habitat_selected == "Selected" & same_location_as_last_survey == "no") %>%
select(Category) %>%
count(Category) %>%
mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)) %>%
add_column(Habitat = "Use") %>%
bind_rows(sin_all) %>%
  
ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Category, y=Percentage, fill = Habitat))+
geom_bar (position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position="bottom") +
ylab("Percentage") +
xlab("Sinuosity Category")
sin_use

```

Comparatively, selected habitat is fairly proportional to the available habitat in each sinuosity category (Figure \@ref(fig:sin-use)), suggesting that fish are not selecting for habitat on a reach scale but rather on a microhabitat scale.

Visually, the boxplot distributions for depth availability and use are relatively similar (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-fig) ), however there is a statistically significant difference between group means (p<0.05; Table \@ref(tab:depth-tab) with fish selecting for shallower habitats. This inference should be used with caution though, due to potential sampling bias.

tidy_vel <- tidy(vel_t)

vel_tab = tidy_vel %>%

There is a statistically significant difference between velocity availability and use in the lower Lemhi River (Table \@ref(tab:vel-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:vel-fig) ), suggesting that juvenile Chinook are selecting for limited, slow water habitat during the winter season.

There are statistically significant differences in the distribution of channel units selected by radio-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon during winter months and what is available in the lower Lemhi River, across all three sinuosity categories (Table \@ref(tab:cu-tab)). It appears that juvenile Chinook salmon tend to use pools and off-channel areas at a higher frequency than their availability, and riffles at a lower frequency compared to what is available (Figure \@ref(fig:cu-fig)).

There appears to be very little difference in the substrate concealment between what is available and what is selected by juvenile Chinook salmon for both the medium and high sinuosity categories. There is a difference in the little sinuosity category (Table \@ref(tab:conceal-tab); however, Figure \@ref(fig:conceal-fig) indicates that in low sinuosity reaches, fish are more likely to select habitat that does not contain substrate concealment, contrary to our suspicions.

Unlike concealment, it does appear that radio-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon are more likely to select habitat where some form of cover is available (within a 1.5 m radius), compared to what is available, across all three sinuosity categories (Table \@ref(tab:cover-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:cover-fig)).

# Discussion

## Habitat Availability Power Analysis

The distributions of the depths and velocities from the sampled transects and the rasters covering the entirety of the lower Lemhi River are nearly identical within each sinuosity class. This suggest that the sampled transects are capturing the distribution of available habitat well, and did not need to be supplemented with additional transects. Certainly, we are interested in habitat metrics other than depth and velocity, but without somehow simulating the true distributions of those metrics (e.g., substrate class, fish cover, etc.)) it would be difficult to conduct a worthwhile power analysis to evaluate whether our current dataset is sufficient to capture those distributions. Depth and velocity were used as proxies for everything else, because we had model outputs for them across the entire Lemhi River, which we treated as the "truth". We feel that the habitat availability dataset available from line transects in the lower Lemhi River is sufficient to capture the true available habitat.

## Habitat Preference

### Sinuosity
With no real pattern in fish use relative to reaches categorized by low, medium or high sinuosity, it appears that fish are not selecting for habitat at the reach scale. 

### Depth and Velocity
While our analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the mean water depth that fish were using compared to available depths, sampling bias excluded deeper detected tag locations from the dataset because those locations were not safe to measure.  While we're not sure, had these omitted data points been included, a statistically significant difference may not have been calculated. 

Alternatively, we feel the statistically significant difference in the velocities found at used habitat locations compared to available habitat is a valid analysis. Had higher velocities been included in the dataset to potentially shift the use distribution, those locations would have been filtered out based on literature detailing the upper limit of sustained swimming for juvenile salmonids (used as criteria in decision tree for qualifying habitat use). Strikingly, the mean velocity for available habitat (0.99 m/s) is significantly greater than the upper limit for sustained swimming speed (0.67 m/s) of a 111 mm fish, the average size Chinook in the study .

### Channel Units
Statistical analysis shows juvenile Chinook selecting for pools and off-channel areas at a higher frequency than what is available.  This supports the idea that these fish are seeking refuge from high velocities (i.e., riffles) which could be an important survival and fitness strategy during the winter months when fish are trying to maintain condition factor.

### Concealment
Contrary to our hypothesis, there was more concealment habitat available in the lower Lemhi than what was being used by juvenile Chinook.  One reason for this may be explained by fish seeking slow water habitat.  Generally, slow water habitat is associated with finer bed material (i.e., gravel, sands, fines) deposition. So, fish may not be selecting for areas where concealment is absent but rather low velocity is a more important habitat component than substrate concealment.  Also, while surveyors did their best to categorize substrate accurately, turbidity in the Lemhi River, especially at higher winter flows, made substrate observations challenging.

### Cover
Statistical analysis shows that fish use habitat with cover in significantly greater proportions that what is available to them. This analysis is likely understated too.  Because microhabitat availability surveys were conducted in August, overhanging vegetation was likely more prominent with leaves.  In the winter, during microhabitat use surveys, trees and plants had lost their leaves resulting in less available cover. How significant this may be is questionable but should be considered in the context of the seasonality of the two surveys.  

### Conclusion 

From our observations and analysis of winter habitat use in the lower Lemhi River, we conclude that juvenile Chinook are selecting for slow-water microhabitat with cover.  Our habitat availability surveys and analysis suggest that this habitat type is limited in the lower Lemhi.  We think this information supports previous research conducted in the Lemhi River and help guide restoration efforts.  

While we believe this habitat availability and use study has been worthwhile and its findings are relevant to restoration efforts in the Lemhi River, it must be understood that the study does not come without some major confounding factors.  Those factors include:

* Radio telemetry technology
* Predation
* Sample size
* Sampling bias due to environmental conditions

Because we were unable to confirm if radio tag detections were truly live fish and a high percentage of radio were physically recovered (22% of detected tags during microhabitat surveys), we hypothesize that tag antennas became entangled with physical habitat features when fish sought cover resulting in shed tags. Predation also likely contributed to the high tag recovery rate. 
Ideally, we would have had a larger sample size of habitat use observations for a more robust analysis and better representation of the population sampled. 

Largely due to environmental conditions microhabitat use surveys were not always feasible during certain times of the winter or in certain sections of the river.  When the river was not navigable by boat due to surface ice, we were forced to conduct surveys by foot which limited access to only those areas where we had landowner permission.  Also, river conditions prevented us from collecting all desired metrics (i.e., depth and velocity) at all detected tag locations.
